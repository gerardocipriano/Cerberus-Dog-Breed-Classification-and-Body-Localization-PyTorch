The dataset includes 302 images.
Body-parts are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -20° to +20° horizontally and -20° to +20° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -40 and +40 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
